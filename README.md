## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I got to practice the css Grid Feature. Enjoyed it and the project was much fun and interesting to implement. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@media (min-width: 700px){
    .container{
        grid-template-columns: repeat(3,1fr);
        grid-template-rows: repeat(2,1fr);
        place-items: center;
    }
```


### Continued development

I want to build a bigger portoflio using css grid and improve my ability to use it exceptionally.
